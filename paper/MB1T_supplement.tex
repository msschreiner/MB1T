\end{figure}

Are there stable individual differences in how likely an infant is to contribute a high number of trials?
To answer this question, we conducted an exploratory analysis investigating whether there is a relationship between the number of trials an infant contributed in session 1 and session 2.
Do infants who contribute a higher number of trials during their first testing session also tend to contribute more trials during their second testing session?
A positive correlation between trial numbers during the first and second session would indicate that their is some stability in a given infants' likelihood of remaining attentive throughout the experiment.
On the other hand, the absence of a correlation would indicate that the number of trials a given infant contributes is not predictive of how many trials they might contribute during their next session.

We found a strong positive correlation between number of trials contributed during the first and the second session \(r = .58\), 95\% CI \([.47, .68]\), \(t(159) = 9.05\), \(p < .001\) (see Figure 1).
This result suggests that if infants contribute a higher number of trials in one session, compared to other infants, they are likely to contribute a higher number of trials in their next session.
This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that how attentive infants are throughout an experiment (and hence how many trials they contribute) is a stable individual difference, at least for some infant looking time tasks.
Researchers should therefore be mindful of the fact that decisions about including or excluding infants based on trials contributed may selectively sample a specific sub-set of the infant population they are studying (Byers-Heinlein, Bergmann, \& Savalei, 2021; DeBolt, Rhemtulla, \& Oakes, 2020).

\hypertarget{s2-patterns-of-preference-across-sessions}{%
\subsection{S2: Patterns of preference across sessions}\label{s2-patterns-of-preference-across-sessions}}

We also conducted analyses to explore whether there were any patterns of preference reversal across test sessions.
While there was no strong correlation in the magnitude of IDS preference between test session 1 and test session 2, here we asked whether infants consistently expressed the same preference across test sessions.
Overall, 53.80\% of the infants had a consistent preference from test to retest session, indicating that infants were not more likely than chance to maintain their preference from test session 1 to test session 2 (exact binomial test; \emph{p} =
0.38).
Of the 158 total infants, 42.40\% of infants showed a consistent infant-directed speech preference and 11.40\% showed a consistent adult-directed speech preference.
24.70\% of infants switched from an infant-directed speech preference at test session 1 to an adult-directed speech preference at test session 2 and 21.50\% switched from an adult-directed speech preference to an infant-directed speech preference.

Next, we explored whether we could detect any systematic clustering of infants with distinct patterns of preference across the test and retest session.
We took a bottom-up approach and conducted a \emph{k}-means clustering of the test-retest difference data.
We found little evidence of distinct clusters emerging from these groupings: the clusterings ranging from \emph{k}=2 (2 clusters) to \emph{k}=4 (4 clusters) appear to simply track whether participants are approximately above or below the mean looking time difference for test session 1 and test session 2, and the diagnostic elbow plot shows little evidence of a qualitative improvement as the number of clusters is increased.

In (A), points represent indvidual participants' magnitude of looking time difference at test sessions 1 (x-axis) and 2 (y-axis). The solid line indicates no preference for IDS vs.~ADS, the dotted lines indicate mean IDS preference at test session 1 and 2, respectively. Colors indicate clusters from the k-means clustering for different values of k.}

\subsection{S3: Deviations from the preregistration}\label{s3-deviations-from-the-preregistration}}

Below, we document all deviations from the preregistered methods and analyses \url{https://osf.io/v5f8t}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All infants with usable data for both test and retest session were included in the analyses, regardless of the number of total of infants a lab was able to contribute after exclusion. This decision is consistent with past decisions in ManyBabies projects to be as inclusive about data inclusion as possible (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020).
\item
  A small number of infants with a time between sessions above 31 days were also included in the analyses (n=2).
\item
  Consistent with analytic decisions in ManyBabies 1 (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020), total looking times were truncated at 18 seconds (the maximum trial time) in the small number of cases where recorded looking times were slightly greater than 18s (presumably due to small measurement error in recording infant looking times).
\end{itemize}
