\section{S1. Notes on and deviations from the preregistration}\label{s1.-notes-on-and-deviations-from-the-preregistration}}

Below, we have compiled a list of notes on and deviations from the preregistered methods and analyses available at \url{https://osf.io/v5f8t}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All infants with usable data for both test and retest session were included in the analyses, regardless of the number of total infants a lab was able to contribute after exclusion. This decision is consistent with past decisions in ManyBabies projects to be as inclusive about data inclusion as possible (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020).
\item
  A small number of infants whose time between sessions exceeded 31 days were still included in the analyses (\emph{n} = 3).
\item
  Consistent with analytic decisions in ManyBabies 1 (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020), total looking times were truncated at 18 seconds (the maximum trial time) in the small number of cases where recorded looking times were slightly greater than 18s (presumably due to small measurement error in recording infant looking times).
\item
  In assessing differences in IDS preference between test and retest sessions, we preregistered an additional linear mixed-effects model including a by-lab random slope for session. This model yielded qualitatively equivalent results (see R markdown of the main manuscript). However, the model resulted in a singular fit, suggesting that the model specification may be overly complex and that its estimates should be interpreted with caution. We therefore focused only on the first preregistered model (including only by-lab and by-participant random intercepts) in reporting the analyses in the main manuscript.
\item
  In assessing the reliability of IDS using a linear mixed-effects model predicting IDS preference in session 2 from IDS preference in session 1, we also assessed the robustness of the results by fitting a second preregistered model with more complex random effects structure, including a by-lab random slope for IDS preference in session 1. This model is included in the main R markdown script and yields qualitatively equivalent results to the model reported in the manuscript that includes a by-lab random intercept only.
\item
  We report a series of secondary planned analyses in the Supplementary Materials exploring potential moderating variables of time between test sessions (S2.1), the language background of the participants (S2.2.), and participant age (S2.3.).
\item
  We did not fit all models (in particular, the models investigating interactions between moderators) described in the secondary analyses of the preregistration, because our final sample size was smaller than we anticipated, which made it less feasible to investigate more complex relationships between moderators.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{s2.1.-time-between-test-sessions}{%
\subsection{S2.1. Time between test sessions}\label{s2.1.-time-between-test-sessions}}

The number of days between the first and second testing session varied widely across participants (mean: 10 days; range: 1 - 49 days). We therefore tested for the possibility that the time between sessions might have an impact on test-retest reliability. We fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting IDS preference in Session 2 from IDS preference in Session 1 (mean-centered), number of days between testing sessions (mean-centered), and their interaction, including a by-lab random intercept and random slope for IDS preference in Session 1.
A more complex random effects structure including additional random slopes for number of days between test sessions and its interaction with IDS preference in Session 1 did not converge.
We found no evidence that the number of days between test sessions moderated the relationship between IDS preference in Session 1 and 2. Neither the main effect of time between sessions, \(\beta\)=-0.01, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}(148.70)=-0.41, \emph{p}=.684, nor the interaction term, \(\beta\)=-0.01, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}(149.10)=-0.73, \emph{p}=.465, showed significant effects.

\end{figure}

NAE-learning infants showed greater IDS preferences than their non-NAE counterparts in MB1.
We therefore also assessed whether test-retest reliability interacted with children's language background.
A linear mixed-effects model predicting IDS preference in Session 2 based on IDS preference in Session 1 (mean-centered), NAE (centered), and their interaction, including Lab as a random intercept, revealed no interaction, \(\beta\)=0.29, \emph{SE}=0.18, \emph{t}(151.30)=1.59, \emph{p}=.115 (Figure 1).

\hypertarget{s2.3.-participant-age}{%
\subsection{S2.3. Participant age}\label{s2.3.-participant-age}}

To investigate the possibility that age moderated test-retest reliability, we fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting IDS preference in Session 2 from IDS preference in Session 1 (mean-centered), participant age (mean-centered) and their interaction.
The model included a by-lab random intercept and a by-lab random slope for IDS preference in Session 1.
We found no evidence that age influenced test-retest reliability as indicated by the interaction between IDS preference in Session 1 and age, \(\beta\)=0.00, \emph{SE}=0.00, \emph{t}(76.60)=-0.85, \emph{p}=.398.

\end{figure}

In addition to the methods for assessing test-retest reliability reported in the main manuscript, we also investigated test-retest reliability across labs using a meta-analytic approach.
We used the metafor package (Viechtbauer, 2010) to fit a mixed-effects meta-analytic model on z-transformed correlations for each combination of lab and method using sample size weighting.
The model included random intercepts for lab and method.
The overall effect size estimate was not significantly different from zero, \emph{b} = -0.04, 95\% CI = {[}-0.26, 0.19{]}, \emph{p} = 0.73.
A forest plot of the effect sizes for each lab and method is shown in Figure 2.

\section{S4. Alternative dependent variables}\label{s4.-alternative-dependent-variables}}

To check the robustness of our results, we also investigated whether we obtained similar results with other possible dependent measures: average log-transformed looking times and a proportion-based preference measure. For each alternative dependent variable, we conducted the main analyses of test-retest reliability reported in the manuscript: the overall Pearson correlation, the test-retest linear mixed-effects model, and an inspection of applying stricter inclusion criteria for number of trials contributed.

\end{figure}

In these analyses, we calculated IDS preference by first log-transforming looking times for each trial, computing the average log-transformed looking time for IDS and ADS for each participant, and calculating the difference between average IDS and ADS log-transformed looking times.
We fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting IDS preference in Session 2 from IDS preference in Session 1, including a by-lab random intercept.
As in the analyses using average raw looking times, the results revealed no significant relationship between IDS preference in Session 1 and 2 (Table 1).
The Pearson correlation coefficient was also not statistically significant, \(r = .03\), 95\% CI \([-.12, .19]\), \(t(156) = 0.43\), \(p = .670\).
Applying successively stricter inclusion criteria --- by requiring a higher number of valid trials per condition in each session --- showed a similar pattern to the main manuscript, such that correlations increased somewhat with stricter inclusion criteria, but substantially reduced the sample size at the same time (Figure 3).

\hypertarget{s4.2.-proportion-looking-to-ids}{%
\subsection{S4.2. Proportion looking to IDS}\label{s4.2.-proportion-looking-to-ids}}

Next, we calculated a proportion-based IDS preference measure by computing the average proportion (raw) looking time to IDS relative to total (raw) looking time to IDS and ADS for each subject (i.e., IDS looking time / (ADS looking time + IDS looking time)).
We fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting proportion-based IDS preference in Session 2 from proportion-based IDS preference in Session 1, including a by-lab random intercept.
As in the analyses using other measures of IDS preference, the results revealed no significant relationship between IDS preference in Session 1 and 2 (Table 2).
The Pearson correlation coefficient based on proportional IDS looking was also not statistically significant, \(r = .01\), 95\% CI \([-.15, .16]\), \(t(156) = 0.09\), \(p = .927\).
Stricter inclusion criteria increased the correlation somewhat, as in previous analyses (Figure 4).

\section{S5. Sensitivity of test-retest reliability to trial number inclusion criteria}\label{s5.-sensitivity-of-test-retest-reliability-to-trial-number-inclusion-criteria}}

To conduct a more fine-grained analysis of how stricter trial inclusion criteria affect test-retest reliability, we computed correlations while gradually increasing the number of total valid trials required for inclusion.
For this analysis, we required a minimum of one IDS and one ADS trial and gradually increased the number of total valid trials required in both sessions (irrespective of IDS and ADS condition) from 2 to 16 (the maximum number of total trials).
Figure 5 depicts the Pearson correlation coefficients for increasingly stricter requirements for the overall trial numbers of a given participant in both sessions.
Correlations only increase and reach conventional levels of significance once the number of total required trials for both sessions is greater than 12.

\hypertarget{s6.-patterns-of-preference-across-sessions}{%
\section{S6. Patterns of preference across sessions}\label{s6.-patterns-of-preference-across-sessions}}

We also conducted analyses to explore whether there were any patterns of preference reversal across test sessions.
While there was no strong correlation in the magnitude of IDS preference between test session 1 and test session 2, here we asked whether infants consistently expressed the same preference across test sessions.
Overall, 58.20\% of the infants had a consistent preference from test to retest session.
Of the 158 total infants, 44.90\% of infants showed a consistent IDS preference and 13.30\% showed a consistent ADS preference.
23.40\% of infants switched from an IDS preference at test session 1 to an ADS preference at test session 2 and 18.40\% switched from an ADS preference to an IDS preference.

Next, we explored whether we could detect any systematic clustering of infants with distinct patterns of preference across the test and retest session.
We took a bottom-up approach and conducted a \emph{k}-means clustering of the test-retest difference data (here using log-transformed looking time data).
We found little evidence of distinct clusters emerging from these groupings: the clusterings ranging from \emph{k}=2 (2 clusters) to \emph{k}=4 (4 clusters) appear to mainly track whether participants are approximately above or below the mean looking time difference for test session 1 and test session 2 (Figure 6A).
The diagnostic elbow plot shows little evidence of a qualitative improvement as the number of clusters is increased, which suggests little evidence for a distinctive set of clusters of participants who showed similar patterns of looking across the test and retest sessions (Figure 6B).

The solid line indicates no preference for IDS vs.~ADS, the dotted lines indicate mean IDS preference at test session 1 and 2, respectively.

\caption{\label{fig:sfig7}Correlation between the number of trials contributed in Session 1 and Session 2. Each data point represents one infant. Colored lines represent linear fits for each method.}
\end{figure}

Are there stable individual differences in how likely an infant is to contribute a high number of trials?
To answer this question, we conducted an exploratory analysis investigating whether there is a relationship between the number of trials an infant contributed in Session 1 and Session 2.
Do infants who contribute a higher number of trials during their first testing session also tend to contribute more trials during their second testing session?
A positive correlation between trial numbers during the first and second session would indicate that there is some stability in a given infants' likelihood of remaining attentive throughout the experiment.
On the other hand, the absence of a correlation would indicate that the number of trials a given infant contributes is not predictive of how many trials they might contribute during their next session.

We found a strong positive correlation between number of trials contributed during the first and the second session \(r = .58\), 95\% CI \([.47, .68]\), \(t(159) = 9.05\), \(p < .001\) (Figure 7).
This result suggests that if infants contribute a higher number of trials in one session, compared to other infants, they are likely to contribute a higher number of trials in their next session.
This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that how attentive infants are throughout an experiment (and hence how many trials they contribute) is a stable individual difference, at least for some infant looking time tasks.
Researchers should therefore be mindful of the fact that decisions about including or excluding infants based on trials contributed may selectively sample a specific sub-set of the infant population they are studying (Byers-Heinlein, Bergmann, \& Savalei, 2021; DeBolt, Rhemtulla, \& Oakes, 2020).

\hypertarget{s8.-correlations-in-average-looking-times-between-sessions}{%
\section{S8. Correlations in average looking times between sessions}\label{s8.-correlations-in-average-looking-times-between-sessions}}

To what extent are participants looking times between the two sessions related?
To test this question, we first investigated whether participants' overall looking times --- irrespective of condition --- were correlated between the first and second session.
There was a robust correlation between average looking time in Session 1 and Session 2: infants with longer looking times during their first session also tended to look longer during their second session, \(r = .45\), 95\% CI \([.31, .57]\), \(t(156) = 6.28\), \(p < .001\).
This relationship held even after controlling for number of trials in the first and second session, suggesting that the relation between average looking in Session 1 and 2 could not be entirely explained by the correlation in the number of trials contributed between the two sessions (S7), \(b = 0.42\), 95\% CI \([0.27, 0.58]\), \(t(154) = 5.52\), \(p < .001\) (Figure 8A).
The result is also similar when controlling for participants' average age across the two test sessions, \(b = 0.44\), 95\% CI \([0.30, 0.59]\), \(t(155) = 6.16\), \(p < .001\).

Next, we explored the extent to which average looking times for IDS and ADS stimuli were related.
First, we found similar correlations in average looking time to IDS stimuli in Session 1 and 2, \(r = .38\), 95\% CI \([.24, .51]\), \(t(156) = 5.19\), \(p < .001\), and ADS stimuli in Session 1 and 2, \(r = .40\), 95\% CI \([.26, .53]\), \(t(156) = 5.49\), \(p < .001\) (Figure 8B).
To test whether these correlations were specific to looking times for IDS or ADS stimuli alone, we fit linear regression models predicting average looking to IDS (or ADS) stimuli in Session 2 from average looking to IDS and ADS stimuli in Session 1.
We found that average looking to IDS stimuli in Session 2 could be predicted from average looking to IDS stimuli in Session 1, even after controlling for average looking to ADS stimuli in Session 1, \(b = 0.21\), 95\% CI \([0.01, 0.41]\), \(t(155) = 2.11\), \(p = .037\).
Conversely, average looking to ADS stimuli in Session 2 could be predicted from average looking to ADS stimuli in Session 1, even after controlling for average looking to IDS stimuli in Session 1, \(b = 0.36\), 95\% CI \([0.14, 0.58]\), \(t(155) = 3.20\), \(p = .002\).
These results suggest that the condition-specific correlations in average looking time cannot be fully explained by the fact that infants' overall looking times between sessions are correlated.

Finally, we inspected item-level correlations between the two test sessions.
Specifically, we investigated the relation between items composed of the same recording clips in Session 1 and Session 2 (but with a reversed order of clips between the two sessions).
We fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting item-level looking time in Session 2 from item-level looking time in Session 1, including random intercepts for participant, item, and lab, as well as a random slope for item-level looking time in Session 1 for participant and lab.
Item-level looking in Session 2 was related to item-level looking in Session 1, \(\hat{\beta} = 0.17\), 95\% CI \([0.07, 0.27]\), \(t(5.52) = 3.38\), \(p = .017\) (Figure 8C).
Similar results hold if looking times are log-transformed

Finally, we inspected on a more fine-grained item level whether IDS preference in Session 1 was related to IDS preference in Session 2.
To do so, we exploited the fact the specific IDS and ADS stimuli were paired together in test orders in both sessions, such that one IDS stimulus (e.g., IDS1) always occurred adjacently to a specific ADS stimulus (e.g., ADS1).
We therefore computed stimulus-specific IDS preference scores by calculating the difference in raw looking time for each of the eight IDS-ADS stimulus pairs for each participant (whenever both trials in a given pair were available).
We then fit a linear mixed-effects model predicting stimulus-specific IDS preference in Session 2 from stimulus-specific IDS preference in Session 1, including by-participant and by-lab random intercepts (models with more complex random effects structure, including by-item random effects, failed to converge).
There was a marginal, but non-significant relation in stimulus-specific IDS preference between the two test sessions (Table 3).
